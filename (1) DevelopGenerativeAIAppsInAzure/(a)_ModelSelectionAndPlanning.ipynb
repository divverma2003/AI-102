        "- Review training data for representativeness\n",
        "- Evaluate predictive performance across user population subsections\n",
        "- Consider fairness from the beginning of development process\n",

        "**Key Areas**:\n",
        "- **Training Data**: Large volumes may contain personal details requiring protection\n",

        "**Principle**: People should be accountable for AI systems\n",
        "\n",
        "**Responsibility Chain**:\n",
        "- Developers who trained and validated models\n",
