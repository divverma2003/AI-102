    "## Use a Prompt Flow to Manage Conversation in a Chat App\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Use Azure AI Foundry Prompt Flow to design, test, and deploy a custom chat experience that incorporates user input and chat history with a GPT model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** ~30 minutes\n",
    "**Status:** Some features are preview / in active development\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Create a Foundry Hub and Project\n",
    "\n",
    "> Prompt Flow requires a **Foundry hub–based project**, not a project based only on a Foundry resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create the Hub-Based Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open **[https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com)** and sign in.\n",
    "2. Close tips and help panes.\n",
    "3. Navigate to:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `https://ai.azure.com/managementCenter/allResources`\n",
    "4. Select **Create new** → **AI hub resource**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Create a project** wizard:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Project name: Valid name\n",
    "* Hub: **Create new hub** → Rename to a unique alphanumeric name\n",
    "* Expand **Advanced options**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Important:** If *Create* is disabled, ensure the hub name is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait for the project and hub to be created.\n",

    "## 2. Configure Resource Authorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt flows store assets in **Blob Storage**, so the Foundry resource must have permission to read blobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enable Managed Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open **[https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)** in a new tab.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assign Storage Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Return to the resource group.\n",
    "2. Select the **Storage account** for the hub.\n",
    "3. Open **Access Control (IAM)**.\n",
    "4. Add a role assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Role:** Storage Blob Data Reader\n",
    "   * **Assignee:** Foundry resource managed identity\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows Prompt Flow to read flow assets from storage.\n",
