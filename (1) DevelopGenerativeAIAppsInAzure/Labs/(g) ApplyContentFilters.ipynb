    "# Apply Content Filters to Prevent Harmful Content\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content filters** in Microsoft Foundry help prevent the generation of harmful, offensive, or unsafe content. Foundry provides **default filters**, and also allows you to define **custom content filters** to better align with your Responsible AI requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters for AI-102:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Content filtering is a core **Responsible AI** control\n",
    "* Filters apply to both **prompts (input)** and **completions (output)**\n",
    "* Custom filters allow stricter enforcement for sensitive scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated time:** ~25 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts (Exam Focus)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Default content filters:** Balanced protection applied automatically\n",
    "* **Custom content filters:** User-defined thresholds per category\n",
    "* **Input filters:** Evaluate user prompts\n",
    "* **Output filters:** Evaluate model responses\n",
    "* **Prompt shields:** Protect against prompt injection and abuse\n",
